TEDxYouth@Toronto 2012 is the third annual and official TEDxYouth Day conference to be held in Toronto. This year’s event will take place Saturday, November 17th, 2012 at the Ontario Science Centre. The TEDxYouth@Toronto team is very excited to bring you what we feel will be our most (r)evolutionary event yet!

## Attend

There are 200 spots reserved for general attendees to participate in the live event. Tickets are free of charge and open to all GTA high school students via a quick application process. Applications are now open until October 20th, and selected attendees will be notified at the end of October.
If you are not selected as a general attendee or are not a high school student, you can still participate in this year’s event! The event will be live streamed to a global audience so you can tune in on November 17th – details to follow. We will also be hosting our official satellite event at the ING Direct Café at 221 Yonge Street for anyone who would like to attend – we’ll be posting details about the satellite closer to the event so stay tuned!

## Speakers

This year’s theme, (R)evolution, focuses on the evolution of our society, as well as the revolutionary ideas, visionaries and movements that have made the world a better place. TEDxYouth@Toronto 2012 will be a celebration of positive change and will inspire you to challenge the status quo by showcasing a line-up of leading revolutionaries within their fields. We bring to you the evolved revolution.

Our first round of speakers includes Dr. Jeremy Friedberg, co-founder of Spongelab Interactive, and Natalie Panek, Mission Systems and Operations Engineer with MDA Space Missions.

Make sure you follow us on Twitter and Facebook for the latest updates as we share more details about this year’s event!

## TEDxYouth@Toronto Blog

Our blog is something new to our re-vamped site, and will give us a chance to share more from behind-the-scenes of organizing this event. This is my third year chairing this event, and I’m excited to share updates from our amazing team with you.

## Youth Ambassadors

Another first this year is our fantastic team of youth ambassadors, representing TEDxYouth@Toronto from schools across the GTA. These ambassadors were selected from numerous applications for their passion and excitement about this year’s event. Keep an eye out for articles and Tweets from them as they spread TEDxYouth@Toronto throughout the community. If you missed out on being a youth ambassador, don’t worry, we’ll be looking for more next year – and you can still participate as a general attendee.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at info@tedxyouthtoronto.ca. Any media inquiries can be directed to media@tedxyouthtoronto.ca. We look forward to seeing you at this year’s event!

Cheers to ideas worth spreading!
