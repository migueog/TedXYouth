Choosing a TEDx theme is not a simple process. It has to be relatable to the audience yet pertinent to all disciplines while encouraging discussion and new insights.

This year, our difficulty was trying to steer away from 2014’s theme of “Ignite,” yet deciding on a concept that is equally moving and thought-provoking. After painstaking deliberation, the theme for this November is “Switch: Change Your Focus.”

There were many ideas behind this theme. The concept of shifting perspectives or considering new influences and possibilities. It happens when we challenge our thinking or experience a sudden change of mindset when something just clicks.

Take a moment to consider what “Switch” means to you. It’s open to interpretation and we’d love to hear your thoughts. Share your ideas with us on Facebook and Twitter!
