Since April, the Organizing Committee was working hard to create a fantastic experience for November 16. That special day finally arrived this past Saturday and the pieces from each team came together.

Early in the morning, the sponsors set up their booths, the speakers practiced their presentations and the Organizing Committee prepared the final details. Everyone was eager and waiting for the 250 delegates to arrive. When the youth arrived the energy was contagious – each one was excited for the talks, getting new contacts and sharing ideas.

The TEDxYouth@Toronto Organizing Team would like to send out a few heartfelt thank-you’s to those that made our vision for November 16 come true. Thank you to the sponsors, the speakers, the performers, the Emcee and, of course, thank you to YOU, the youth.

 Currently the photos from event-day are being prepared and the videos of the talks are being edited. Stay tuned for those in the coming weeks and keep updated by following us on social media. Hope to see you next year!
