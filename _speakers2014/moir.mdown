bio: Skating together since 1997, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir have consistently placed amongst the top of the pack at International ice dancing competitions, including a gold medal at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, two silver medals at the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi and gold at the 2010 and 2012 World Figure Skating Championships. Virtue and Moir are also six-time Canadian National Champions, winning in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The pair are known for their intricate footwork and innovative lifts. Born in London, Ontario into a sports-oriented family, Tessa was an exceptional gymnast and ballet dancer growing up. In fact, she was chosen at a young age to join the National Ballet of Canada. Enjoying both dance and skating, Tessa realized that she could have the best of both worlds as an ice dancer. Tessa is currently pursuing her degree in psychology. Scott was born and raised in Ilderton, Ontario just outside of London, into an athletic family heavily involved in the skating world. With a natural skating ability at a young age, Scott began his skating career on hockey skates with a dream of one day playing professional hockey. During a summer skating camp in Ilderton, Scott’s first figure skating coach and aunt Carol noticed Tessa Virtue, who seemed like the perfect complement to Scott’s size and ability. Noting the connection, Carol paired Tessa and Scott together at the age of seven and nine and they have been skating together ever since.
