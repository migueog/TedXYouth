	<h1>About Our Awesome Team</h1>
	<p>TEDxYouth@Toronto is the first and longest running TEDxYouth event in Canada. Thanks to our passionate, dedicated, and enthusiastic volunteer team, we have been able to run 7 successful TEDx events in the past 7 years for high school students in the Greater Toronto Area. TEDxYouth@Toronto believes that positive change in the world comes from empowered youth. To inspire youth, our volunteers are expected to lead by example: with a demonstrated commitment to the organization, a get-it-done attitude, and a collaborative mindset. If this is YOU, we would love for you to apply to join our team!</p>
	<p>Working on the TEDxYouth@Toronto team is a lot of fun, but it is also a serious commitment. We anticipate that the time commitment will be 5 hours per week (varying throughout the year) from April 2017 until March 2018. As well, we have monthly general meetings for all our team members, and weekly or biweekly meetings for smaller teams. Please consider your personal and professional commitments carefully before you click to apply. If you are unable to commit for the full duration or some of our general meetings but are still interested, please send us an email and we can chat.</p>
	<p>We always receive several applications from high school students interested in helping out with our event. However, we are only targeting applicants who have graduated from high school to join our team. If you’re in high school and would like to help out, check back in June for our Youth Ambassador Program applications.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions at all about the application process, please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:info@tedxyouthtoronto.ca">info@tedxyouthtoronto.ca</a>.</p>
