        <p>We have had an overwhelming response to our call for applications for the 2016 team. We appreciate your enthusiasm and wanted to thank everyone for taking time to apply to join the team.</p>
      <h2>About the Team</h2>
        <p>TEDxYouth@Toronto believes that positive change in the world comes from empowered youth. To inspire youth, our volunteers are expected to lead by example: with a demonstrated commitment to the organization, a get-it-done attitude, and a collaborative mindset.
Working on the TEDxYouth@Toronto team is lots of fun, but it is a serious commitment as well. We anticipate that the time commitment will be 5 hours per week (varying throughout the year) from March 2016 until November 2017. If you are unable to commit for the full duration but are still interested, please send us an email and we can chat.
We are always receive several applications from from high school students interested in helping out with our event. However, we are only targeting applicants who have graduated from high school to join our team. If youâ€™re in high school and would like to help out, check back in April for our Youth Ambassador Program applications.
If you have any questions at all about the application process, please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:info@tedxyouthtoronto.ca">info@tedxyouthtoronto.ca</a>.</p>
