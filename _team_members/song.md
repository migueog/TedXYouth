bio: Not-so-meek teacher by day and avid napper by night, Song is interested in what makes the world and its inhabitants tick. She is also concerned with serious philosophical questions, such as whether or not it is acceptable to walk a cat. Most often seen at a 500-level seat at Blue Jays games, she has predicted a World Series win for the franchise every year since 1994.
