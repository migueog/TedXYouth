fname: Shankar
lname: Manoharan

position: Co-Chair

bio: Shankar loves learning about cool, new stuff -- really anything cool and anything new. His commitment using his infatuation with efficiency for good as a supply chain analyst keeps him plenty busy in the day. But given a choice though, he’d much rather spend his time dabbling in competitive robotics, reading, and traveling — which sometimes, but not nearly often enough, intersect to make him unreasonably happy.

talk: His favourite TED Talk is Louis van Ahn’s “Massive-scale Online Collaboration”.
