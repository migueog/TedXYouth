fname: Ellen
lname: Donnelly

position: Delegate Experience Coordinator

bio: Ellen wants to live in a world where emails are short, businesses are innovative & pizza is considered its own food group. Working in the realm of professional sports, she has been instilled with a firm belief in the power of sport to build confident leaders, hard-working teammates, and strong communities. When she's not scouting prospects, you can find Ellen epically failing to cook Pinterest recipes, aimlessly exploring the streets of Toronto, or changing her voicemail greeting for the billionth time.

talk: Her favourite TED talk is Bren√© Brown's "The Power of Vulnerability.
