position: Sponsorship Coordinator

bio: Paris is amazed at how quickly technology has advanced in the last two decades. The movement towards AI (artificial intelligence), the ease in accessing information & processing data and the paradigm shift towards user experience, has reshaped everything we can do as individuals. Aside from learning what new innovations are spawning around the world, she loves to be in nature, races sailboats at Toronto Yacht Clubs, travels any chance she can get and writes poetry when inspired.
