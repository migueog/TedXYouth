fname: Namrata
lname: Narayan

position: Sponsorship Coordinator

bio: Namrata has been casually labelled a "serial volunteer." She's been volunteering for about 10 years, supporting local and international organizations address the challenges of the underserved and voiceless. She's driven by her curiosity 90% of the time - the other 10% is due to her unequivocal love to eat. When she's not searching for a food haven or acting as a brand advisor, you can find her nestled in a local coffee shop corner engrossed watching YouTube clips of The Tonight Show, music videos an, to no surprise, TED Talks. 

talk: If you forced her to pick a favorite Ted Talk, the best she could do is say "any Ken Robinson talk, but start with Bring on the Learning Revolution!"
