bio: Simmer is a 20-something year old political advisor, working out of Queen's Park in Downtown, Toronto. He is somewhat of a geek, who uses dated Star Trek references and dry humour to get his points across. He is passionate about helping others and his enthusiasm is positive in an infectious way. He loves reading books on economics, baking fatty cakes, and leading a healthy lifestyle (not mutually exclusive).

talk: His favourite Ted Talk is Simon Sinek's "How Great Leaders Inspire Action".
