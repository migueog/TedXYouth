There are less than 2 weeks until TEDxYouth@Toronto and we're very excited about the big day!

# 1. 2012 Speaker Introduction Videos

For those who cannot wait, check out our first batch of introduction videos where our speakers offer a glimpse of what they will be sharing on Nov 17th.  Many thanks to Ovu: an Images Life Company for making them!  We've embedded the first of them below.  Check back more as we continue to post new ones.

# 2. Ways to Participate on Nov 17th

For those who cannot join us in-person at the Ontario Science Centre, you can join in and watch all the talks of the day through either of the two options below:

* TEDxYouth@Toronto viewing party at the ING Cafe.  The Downtown ING Cafe will be hosting our official all-ages viewing party on Nov 17th starting at 11am.  Drop by the cafe between 11am and 5pm and bring your friends and family to watch your favorite speakers with other like-minded TEDx'ers!
* Join us on our Live-Stream! TEDxYouth@Toronto 2012 will be live-streamed starting at 11am on Nov 17th!  Grab some popcorn and watch all the talks from the comfort of your own home.  You can even join in the online discussion via our Twitter and Facebook streams (bottom of the page).  Anyone can watch our live-stream, so let your friends know about this as well!  Simply visit our website on Nov 17th to start the stream.

If you have any questions, let us know at GetInvolved@TEDxYouthToronto.ca.
