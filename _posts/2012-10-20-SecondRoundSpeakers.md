## [Andrew Chung [Performer]](http://tedxyouthtoronto.ca/speaker/andrew-pyro-chung/)

Andrew “Pyro” Chung started showing interest in dancing at the age of 12, learning how to do hip-hop choreography from his older sister. From there Pyro discovered the art of street dancing and took on the art of popping at the age of 14, which he continuously strives to perfect. One year later, while still growing as a dancer, Pyro found a natural skill in the art of bboying which then became one of his other main art forms.
