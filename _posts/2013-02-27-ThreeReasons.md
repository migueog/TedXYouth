Your chance to join the TEDxYouth@Toronto team this year has arrived, and the applications are pouring in.  You may be wondering though, what makes this such a unique volunteer opportunity?  Based on input from our team members and my experiences, here are a few reasons why you should apply!

# Inspire GTA youth and introduce them to new ideas and role models.

Our vision when we first started this event was a forum for youth to engage and share ideas, discuss all kinds of topics and hopefully get inspired to start something new!  We are thrilled to see students line up to chat with entrepreneurs and crowd around scientists for autographs instead of the usual celebrities.  We see this happen year after year at the event – youth are excited to learn of all the options that are available to them.  The students soak up an entire day of talks (while furiously scribbling notes), make new friends, and leave TEDxYouth@Toronto empowered!  Who wouldn’t want to be a part of that?

# Meet like-minded young professionals.

We’ve all made those New Year’s resolutions – this year I’m going to network more  And the reality is, it’s harder once you’re done school!  That’s why I’m excited to work with the TEDxYouth@Toronto committee year after year.  Our team attracts a bright and diverse group of young professionals in fields ranging from consulting and finance, to the arts and academia.  What we all have in common is a passion for TED, and the potential that this platform has to make a difference.  Well that, and most of us share a love of baked goods at meetings.  Through my time with the organizing team, I am glad to have met this network of awesome individuals and life-long friends!

# Be part of something much greater than the individual.

I was a keener throughout school, always involved in extra-curriculars and supporting a number of causes.  Entering the workforce was a bit of a rude awakening – for the first time, I felt like I was missing something.  TEDxYouth@Toronto gave me back some of my drive and passion – because let’s face it, there’s more to life than work.  Being part of an event that supports the community and requires a huge team effort is really fulfilling.  I may get tired, I may be frustrated at times, but at the end of the day, I am glad to contribute to something great!  It all hits home on event day when I see hundreds of youth voluntarily waking up early on a Saturday morning to spend the day listening to our incredible speakers.  It is truly remarkable.

There’s one week left to apply to join this year’s organizing team – applications are being accepted until March 6th at midnight.  Don’t miss out on the chance to be part of this amazing experience.
