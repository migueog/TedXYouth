title: Join the TEDxYouth@Toronto 2016 Organizing Committe
date: 2015-02-21

Another year, another fantastic, thought-provoking TEDxYouth@Toronto event. The TEDxYouth@Toronto Organizing Committee is getting ready for its next conference in 2016 and we want you to join our team.

The Organizing Committee was founded seven years ago and ever since we have been coordinating annual conferences featuring talks by the top professionals in their fields. Some of our past speakers include Olympic medalists Scott Moir and Tessa Virtue, Facebook Canada’s Jordan Banks and former astronaut and Member of Parliament Marc Garneau.

Every year, youth from around the globe either join us in person or virtually and each year interest in our conference grows. To keep up with the demand, we are recruiting new members to join the organizing committee. As part of a licensed TEDx team you will be working alongside other dedicated volunteers in the spirit of ideas worth spreading.

If you love TED talks, sharing ideas, and inspiring others, we would love to hear from you! Don’t miss the deadline on March 13, 2016 for your chance to contribute to the biggest and longest running TEDxYouth event.
