Tomorrow is the big day!  We are finalizing the schedule for the day, buying last minute supplies, double-checking our streaming capabilities and setting up the stage at the Ontario Science Centre.


# 1. 2012 Speakers and Performers

For those who cannot wait, check out the bios for our 2012 speakers and performers to get a sneak preview of their talks.  We have also embedded some of the Speaker Introduction Videos on their pages.  Many thanks to Ovu: an Images Life Company for making them!  We’ve embedded Natalie’s below.
