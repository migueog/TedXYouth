Welcome to the new TEDxYouth@Toronto site! We hope you enjoy it as much as we have redesigning it.

Since our inception in 2010, our humble website has been built and maintained by a group of volunteer webmasters (some professional, some self-taught). Our first site has served as well, but as we enter our third year and require additional functionalities, we have sadly outgrown our old site.

Keeping with this year's theme of (R)evolution, we have decided to redesign our website from scratch! Our in-house designer conceptualized our new layout and theme, while our webmasters implemented a more scalable backend on Wordpress, reducing the complexity of adding and updating content.

In this new site, we hope you will enjoy the simplified navigation, cleaner interface, and a more playful design for our ever-youthful audience. While maintaining the iconic TED motif with the distinctive red (for those curious, #FF2B06) and black colors, we have added secondary design elements to highlight this year's theme of (R)evolution.

On our front page, you will also see highlights from our newly launched TEDxYouth@Toronto blog. Check back often as our organizing team and guest writers share their thoughts and TEDx experiences. In the meantime, take a look at the first blog post from our event chair, Sabeen, as she kicks off the 2012 year!

In the coming weeks, we will continue to improve the site by adding new content, so donâ€™t be surprised if you see new pages the next time you check back. In the unlikely scenario that you stumble across a 404 page (or an incorrectly rendered page), please let us know so that we can fix it.

Thanks and have fun exploring!
