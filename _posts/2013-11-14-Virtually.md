Less than 3 days away until TEDxYouth@Toronto 2013!

It’s crunch-time for our organizing committee who is busy finalizing the schedule, compiling the delegate package, and arranging last-minute preparations at the Ontario Science Centre.

We are excited about the event this Saturday, Nov 16th, and hope you are too! For those who cannot join us in-person on Saturday, here are a few ways to participate virtually!

# 1) Tune in through our Live-Stream!
  A live-stream will be available for the entire event on November 16th starting at 11am through our homepage. Grab some popcorn and join in the talks from the comfort of your own home.

# 2) Join in on the online discussion!
  We will be active on our Twitter (#TEDxYouthTO) and Facebook feeds on November 16, so share your thoughts and impressions with us. Don’t forget to invite your friends!

In the meantime, we encourage everyone to read our 2013 speaker/performer line-up bios. For those who want to get further into a TED talk mood, check out our 2012 and 2011 speaker talks on our YouTube channel.



Cheers,
TEDxYouth@Toronto Team
